A simple yet powerful tool for every 3D printing enthusiast — especially for Bambu Lab AMS users!
This ESP32-based touchscreen app helps you easily track and manage filament consumption across up to four AMS slots (A1–A4).

Each slot starts with a default value (e.g. 1000 g).
You can log how much filament was used, and the system automatically subtracts it from the total.
All data is stored on an SD card, so your progress is saved even after rebooting.

Designed for the ESP32-2432S028R (Cheap Yellow Display), the interface is clean and responsive — with touch buttons, on-screen numeric input, and color-coded warnings when a spool is running low.

A simple, elegant, and highly practical solution to keep your AMS organized and your filament usage under control.
